Corepack is an experimental tool to help with managing versions of your package managers.

Node.js now has Yarn and pnpm built in through Corepack.

You can tell others which package manager should be used by setting the [packageManager](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/packages.html#packagemanager) in `package.json`.
