-   A hard link is a direct reference to a file via its inode. You can also only hardlink files and not directories.

-   Symbolic links are essentially shortcuts that reference to a file instead of its inode value.

(The inode is a database that describes the file/directory attributes such as metadata and the physical location on the hard drive.)

See:
